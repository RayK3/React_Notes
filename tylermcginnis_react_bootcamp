The Component Lifecycle:
  constructor(): called whenever a component is created
  render(): called whenever the component is rendered
  componentDidMount(): called after a component is mounted to the dom
    - This is where AJAX calls normally sit
  componentDidUpdate(): called after a component is updated
  componentWillUnmount(): called right before a component is unmounted from the dom
  
  Props main job is to pass down a state from a parent component to a child.
  
  If you have state, or a lifecycle event stored in your component, then you need to use a class
